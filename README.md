The Bakers Table is a wesbite for a local café that offers freshly baked breads, pastries and cakes to enjoy either in store or takeaway. The USP is that the cater to many different dietary requirements including gluten/lactose-free, vegetarian and vegan. The website provides the visitor with the full menus for all products available in store.

## Features

### 1. Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar contains the company logo which acts as an anchor to the homepage, and navigation links to all three pages on the website. It is identical across all pages to ensure ease-of-use and consistency.

![Navigation Bar](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/37fe29be-86fe-4cd7-bdeb-4d5d5377911e)

### 2. Hero Image with Action Button
The Main page has an eye-catching hero-image that helps the user understand quickly what the website is for. The image also emphasises the rustic theme of the bakery. It also has a text overlay introducing the user to the website and contains a call to action to view the menu page. This allows quick access to the menu, especially for returning customers or those already aware of the company.

![Main Image](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/4ff08180-f639-4625-b5d1-7a08c0ba1743)

### 3. About the Company
The 'Why Choose Us' section of the page explains the company's three main USPs. I have added an interactive element to encourage users to interact with this section and draw their attention to the content. As the user hovers over the images, the information will appear explaining the significance.

![About The Company](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/4e931fe4-7623-4f48-93bc-68453ef4f3bb)

### 4. Times and Location Section
The last section on the first page has the opening times, address, and an interactive google map for users to locate the bakery. This map can be made larger and also has a link for users to get directions to the bakery from whereever they are.

![Times and Location](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/e0449a94-82b0-49f9-b15b-e0452001d50f)

### 5. Footer
The footer contains links to all of the social media accounts the bakery has. The background color was chosen to draw the eye of the user to the social media links when they scroll down the page. The text was kept minimal to keep the attention on the social media symbols.

![Footer](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/4b033b78-88dc-4f81-aa6a-e6ca94024722)
    
### 6. Menu Page
The Menu page is split into four menu blocks so users can find the products they are looking for easily. Breads, pastries, cakes and drinks with their prices opposite each product. The backgorund image, again, emphasising the freshness of ingredients used and rustic theme without taking away from the menu elements.

![Menu](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/2aa7873f-07de-4379-aea7-7c523a58eac3)

### 7. Contact Form Page
The 'Contact Us' page contains the form users can fill out to contact the bakery. The top of the page has a small paragraph to suggest a couple of queries they can submit to the bakery. The background image is eye catching and compliments the background color of the form, fitting in perfectly with the color scheme.

![Contact Us](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/75c92561-028d-4115-a487-3a628c0dad20)

### 8. Thank You Page
The 'Thank You' page is the page users are redirected to once they have successfully submitted the form. This page has a call to action button which takes users back to the homepage. The background image shows a café table. It shows users what they can expect when they visit the bakery, good coffee and a delicious cake. The lime and mint in the bottom left corner re-enforce the freshness of the products sold by the bakery. The map is also shown again at the end of this page to remind users of the bakery location.

![Thank You](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/e63dade4-03f0-468c-907b-9c9fb43e66e2)
![thankyou page map](https://github.com/Josephine2244/BakersTable/assets/137813807/e9396633-3820-46a9-89b5-7f0f4cd41e32)

## Future features
1. Pre-Order Service for customers to have their orders ready to go for them when they arrive.
2. Updates for charity events being held in the café.
3. Announcements for new items being added to the menu with special recognition if the item was recommended by a customer through the 'Contact Us' form.

## Typography and Color Scheme
### Typography
The fonts used are 'Lora' and 'Merriweather' which are imported from Google Fonts. I chose these because they compliment each other well and are only slightly embellished so they are still easy to read.

### Color Scheme
I based my color scheme off of a color palette I found on icolorpalette.com. I stuck with natural colours (browns, greens, blues). Brown to mimic the color of most bakery products, greens and blues to mimic nature and emphasise freshness of the items and the limited processing that goes into making the products. Almost like a farm-to-table effect.
